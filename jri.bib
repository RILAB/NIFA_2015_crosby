abstract = {There is currently tremendous interest in the possibility of using genome-wide association mapping to identify genes responsible for natural variation, particularly for human disease susceptibility. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is in many ways an ideal candidate for such studies, because it is a highly selfing hermaphrodite. As a result, the species largely exists as a collection of naturally occurring inbred lines, or accessions, which can be genotyped once and phenotyped repeatedly. Furthermore, linkage disequilibrium in such a species will be much more extensive than in a comparable outcrossing species. We tested the feasibility of genome-wide association mapping in A. thaliana by searching for associations with flowering time and pathogen resistance in a sample of 95 accessions for which genome-wide polymorphism data were available. In spite of an extremely high rate of false positives due to population structure, we were able to identify known major genes for all phenotypes tested, thus demonstrating the potential of genome-wide association mapping in A. thaliana and other species with similar patterns of variation. The rate of false positives differed strongly between traits, with more clinal traits showing the highest rate. However, the false positive rates were always substantial regardless of the trait, highlighting the necessity of an appropriate genomic control in association studies.},

Reduced expression of OsCKX2 causes cytokinin accumulation in inflorescence meristems and increases the number of reproductive organs, resulting in enhanced grain yield. QTL pyramiding to combine loci for grain number and plant height in the same genetic background generated lines exhibiting both beneficial traits.

We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in F(2) individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in Neurospora crassa. Sequencing of RAD markers is an integrated platform for SNP discovery and genotyping. This approach should be widely applicable to genetic mapping in a variety of organisms.},

The QTL were originally detected in 1992 by means of ANOVA in a population of 96 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Introgression started from a selected RIL, which was crossed three times to one of the original parents and then self-fertilized, leading to BC(3)S(1) progenies. Markers were used to assist both foreground and background selection at each generation. At the end of the program, the effect of introgression was assessed phenotypically in agronomic trials, and QTL detection was performed by composite interval mapping among BC(3)S(1) progenies. The marker-assisted introgression proved successful at the genotypic level, as analyzed by precision graphical genotypes, although no emphasis was put on the reduction of linkage drag around QTL. Also, QTL positions were generally sustained in the introgression background. For earliness, the magnitude and sign of the QTL effects were in good agreement with those expected from initial RIL analyses. Conversely, for yield, important discrepancies were observed in the magnitude and sign of the QTL effects observed after introgression, when compared to those expected from initial RIL analyses. These discrepancies are probably due to important genotype-by-environment interactions.},

In this study, association mapping was performed on a selected sample of 95 cultivars of soft winter wheat. Population structure was estimated on the basis of 36 unlinked simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The extent of LD was estimated on chromosomes 2D and part of 5A, relative to the LD observed among unlinked markers. Consistent LD on chromosome 2D was <1 cM, whereas in the centromeric region of 5A, LD extended for approximately 5 cM. Association of 62 SSR loci on chromosomes 2D, 5A, and 5B with kernel morphology and milling quality was analyzed through a mixed-effects model, where subpopulation was considered as a random factor and the marker tested was considered as a fixed factor. Permutations were used to adjust the threshold of significance for multiple testing within chromosomes. In agreement with previous QTL analysis, significant markers for kernel size were detected on the three chromosomes tested, and alleles potentially useful for selection were identified. Our results demonstrated that association mapping could complement and enhance previous QTL information for marker-assisted selection.},

Nearly a million plants were assayed in eight environments but showed no evidence for any single large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Instead, we identified evidence for numerous small-effect QTLs shared among families; however, allelic effects differ across founder lines. We identified no individual QTLs at which allelic effects are determined by geographic origin or large effects for epistasis or environmental interactions. Thus, a simple additive model accurately predicts flowering time for maize, in contrast to the genetic architecture observed in the selfing plant species rice and Arabidopsis.},

abstract = {Although molecular markers and DNA sequence data are now available for many crop species, our ability to identify genetic variation associated with functional or adaptive diversity is still limited. In this study, our aim was to quantify and characterize diversity in a panel of cultivated and wild sorghums (Sorghum bicolor), establish genetic relationships, and, simultaneously, identify selection signals that might be associated with sorghum domestication. We assayed 98 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci distributed throughout the genome in a panel of 104 accessions comprising 73 landraces (i.e., cultivated lines) and 31 wild sorghums. Evaluation of SSR polymorphisms indicated that landraces retained 86% of the diversity observed in the wild sorghums. The landraces and wilds were moderately differentiated (F st=0.13), but there was little evidence of population differentiation among racial groups of cultivated sorghums (F st=0.06). Neighbor-joining analysis showed that wild sorghums generally formed a distinct group, and about half the landraces tended to cluster by race. Overall, bootstrap support was low, indicating a history of gene flow among the various cultivated types or recent common ancestry. Statistical methods (Ewens-Watterson test for allele excess, lnRH, and F st) for identifying genomic regions with patterns of variation consistent with selection gave significant results for 11 loci (approx. 15% of the SSRs used in the final analysis). Interestingly, seven of these loci mapped in or near genomic regions associated with domestication-related QTLs (i.e., shattering, seed weight, and rhizomatousness). We anticipate that such population genetics-based statistical approaches will be useful for re-evaluating extant SSR data for mining interesting genomic regions from germplasm collections.},

Here, we use a genome-wide dataset of single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped across 3059 functional genes to study patterns of population structure and identify loci associated with aridity across the natural range of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Overall patterns of population structure, as inferred using principal components and Bayesian cluster analyses, were consistent with three genetic clusters likely resulting from expansions out of Pleistocene refugia located in Mexico and Florida. A novel application of association analysis, which removes the confounding effects of shared ancestry on correlations between genetic and environmental variation, identified five loci correlated to aridity. These loci were primarily involved with abiotic stress response to temperature and drought. A unique set of 24 loci was identified as FST outliers based on the genetic clusters identified previously and after accounting for expansions out of Pleistocene refugia. These loci were involved with a diversity of physiological processes. Identification of non-overlapping sets of loci highlights the fundamental differences implicit in the use of either method, and suggests a pluralistic, yet complementary, approach to the identification of genes underlying ecologically relevant phenotypes.},

Provided that appropriate statistical models correcting for population structure are included, this tool can be used in association analyses to provide high-resolution evaluation of multiple alleles. This study describes the population structure of the 302 lines, and investigates the relationship between population structure and various measures of phenotypic and breeding value. On average, our estimates of population structure account for 9.3% of phenotypic variation, roughly equivalent to a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), with a high of 35%. Inclusion of population structure in association models is critical to meaningful analyses. This new association population has the potential to identify QTL with small effects, which will aid in dissecting complex traits and in planning future projects to exploit the rich diversity present in maize.},

A total of 58 plants were genotyped for 207 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers and phenotyped for 18 characters. One to eight loci were detected for each trait with a total of 63 QTL identified. Overall, 46% of the QTL had allelic effects that were the reverse of those predicted from the parental phenotypes. Wild alleles that were agronomically superior to the cultivated alleles were identified for 42% of the QTL identified for flowering time, flower and fruit number, fruit set, calyx size and fruit glossiness. Comparison of the map positions of eggplant loci with those for similar traits in tomato, potato and pepper revealed that 12 of the QTL have putative orthologs in at least one of these other species and that putative orthology was most often observed between eggplant and tomato. Traits showing potential orthology were: leaf length, shape and lobing; days to flowering; number of flowers per inflorescence; plant height and apex, leaf and stem hairiness. The functionally conserved loci included a major leaf lobing QTL (llob6.1) that is putatively orthologous to the potato leaf (c) and/or Petroselinum (Pts) mutants of tomato, two flowering time QTL (dtf1.1, dtf2.1) that also have putative counterparts in tomato and four QTL for trichomes that have potential orthologs in tomato and potato. These results support the mounting evidence of conservation of gene function during the evolution of eggplant and its relatives from their last common ancestor and indicate that this conservation was not limited to domestication traits.},

We inferred an approximately equal ratio of genes selected during early domestication and genes selected during modern crop breeding. Using an expanded dataset of 48 candidate selected and 658 neutral reference loci, we tested the hypothesis that candidate selected genes in maize are more likely to have transcriptional functions than neutral reference genes, but there was no overrepresentation of regulatory genes in the selected gene dataset. Electronic northern analysis revealed that candidate genes are significantly overexpressed in the maize ear relative to vegetative tissues such as maize shoot, leaf, and root tissue. The maize ear underwent dramatic morphological alteration upon domestication and has been a continuing target of selection for maize yield. Therefore, we hypothesize that genes targeted by selection are more likely to be expressed in tissues that experienced high levels of morphological divergence during domestication and crop improvement.},

abstract = {Asian rice, Oryza sativa, is one of world’s oldest and most important crop species. Rice is believed to have been domesticated approximately 9,000 y ago, although debate on its origin remains contentious. A single-origin model suggests that two main subspecies of Asian rice, indica and japonica, were domesticated from the wild rice O. rufipogon. In contrast, the multiple independent domestication model proposes that these two major rice types were domesticated separately and in different parts of the species range of wild rice. This latter view has gained much support from the observation of strong genetic differentiation between indica and japonica as well as several phylogenetic studies of rice domestication. We reexamine the evolutionary history of domesticated rice by resequencing 630 gene fragments on chromosomes 8, 10, and 12 from a diverse set of wild and domesticated rice accessions. Using patterns of SNPs, we identify 20 putative selective sweeps on these chromosomes in cultivated rice. Demographic modeling based on these SNP data and a diffusion-based approach provide the strongest support for a single domestication origin of rice. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses implementing the multispecies coalescent and using previously published phylogenetic sequence datasets also point to a single origin of Asian domesticated rice. Finally, we date the origin of domestication at approximately 8,200-13,500 y ago, depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used, which is consistent with known archaeological data that suggests rice was first cultivated at around this time in the Yangtze Valley of China.},

abstract = {As part of ongoing studies regarding the genetic basis of quantitative variation in phenotype, we have determined the chromosomal locations of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting fruit size, soluble solids concentration, and pH, in a cross between the domestic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and a closely-related wild species, L. cheesmanii. Using a RFLP map of the tomato genome, we compared the inheritance patterns of polymorphisms in 350 F2 individuals with phenotypes scored in three different ways: (1) from the F2 progeny themselves, grown near Davis, California; (2) from F3 families obtained by selfing each F2 individual, grown near Gilroy, California (F3-CA); and (3) from equivalent F3 families grown near Rehovot, Israel (F3-IS). Maximum likelihood methods were used to estimate the approximate chromosomal locations, phenotypic effects (both additive effects and dominance deviations), and gene action of QTLs underlying phenotypic variation in each of these three environments. A total of 29 putative QTLs were detected in the three environments. These QTLs were distributed over 11 of the 12 chromosomes, accounted for 4.7-42.0% of the phenotypic variance in a trait, and showed different types of gene action. Among these 29 QTLs, 4 were detected in all three environments, 10 in two environments, and 15 in only a single environment. The two California environments were most similar, sharing 11/25 (44%) QTLs, while the Israel environment was quite different, sharing 7/20 (35%) and 5/26 (19%) QTLs with the respective California environments. One major goal of QTL mapping is to predict, with maximum accuracy, which individuals will produce progeny showing particular phenotypes. Traditionally, the phenotype of an individual alone has been used to predict the phenotype of its progeny. Our results suggested that, for a trait with low heritability (soluble solids), the phenotype of F3 progeny could be predicted more accurately from the genotype of the F2 parent at QTLs than from the phenotype of the F2 individual. For a trait with intermediate heritability (fruit pH), QTL genotype and observed phenotype were about equally effective at predicting progeny phenotype. For a trait with high heritability (mass per fruit), knowing the QTL genotype of an individual added little if any predictive value, to simply knowing the phenotype. The QTLs mapped in the L. esculentum X L. cheesmanii F2 appear to be at similar locations to many of those mapped in a previous cross with a different wild tomato (L. chmielewskii).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

A genome wise association analysis was performed per trial, using 811 DArT (R) markers of known map position. At the first stage of analysis, spatially adjusted genotypic means were created per trial by fitting mixed models. At the second stage, single QTL models were fitted with correction for population substructure, using regression models. Finally, multiple QTL models were constructed by backward selection from a regression model containing all significant markers from the single QTL analyses. In addition to the association analyses per trial, genotype by environment interaction was investigated across the six trials. Landraces seemed best adapted to low yielding environments, while old and modern entries adapted better to high yielding environments. The number of QTL and the magnitude of their effects were comparable for low and high input conditions. However, none of the QTL were found within a given bin at any chromosome in more than two of the six trials. Changes in allele frequencies of marker loci close to QTL for grain yield in landraces, old and modern barley cultivars could be attributed to selection exercised in breeding, suggesting that modern breeding may have increased frequencies of marker alleles close to QTL that favour production particularly under high yield potential environments. Moreover, these results also indicate that there may be scope for improving yield under low input systems, as breeding so far has hardly changed allele frequencies at marker loci close to QTL for low yielding conditions.},

Here we focus on efforts to identify the genes responsible for adaptation to domestication. We start from a historical perspective, arguing that Darwin’s conceptualization of domestication and unconscious selection provides valuable insight into the evolutionary history of crops and also provides a framework to evaluate modern methods used to decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic change. We then review these methods, framing the discussion in terms of the phenotype-genotype hierarchy. Top-down approaches, such as quantitative trait locus and linkage disequilibrium mapping, start with a phenotype of interest and use genetic analysis to identify candidate genes. Bottom-up approaches, alternatively, use population genetic analyses to identify potentially adaptive genes and then rely on standard bioinformatics and reverse genetic tools to connect selected genes to a phenotype. We discuss the successes, advantages, and challenges of each, but we conclude that bottom-up approaches to understanding domestication as an adaptive process hold greater promise both for the study of adaptation and as a means to identify genes that contribute to agronomically important traits.},

This variation extends to other species in the genus Zea: although maize and Zea luxurians diverged only approximately 140,000 years ago, their genomes differ in size by approximately 50%. We used paired-end Illumina sequencing to evaluate the potential contribution of TEs to the genome size difference between these two species. We aligned the reads both to a filtered gene set and to an exemplar database of unique repeats representing 1,514 TE families; approximately 85% of reads mapped against TE repeats in both species. The relative contribution of TE families to the B73 genome was highly correlated with previous estimates, suggesting that reliable estimates of TE content can be obtained from short high-throughput sequencing reads, even at low coverage. Because we used paired-end reads, we could assess whether a TE was near a gene by determining if one paired read mapped to a TE and the second read mapped to a gene. Using this method, Class 2 DNA elements were found significantly more often in genic regions than Class 1 RNA elements, but Class 1 elements were found more often near other TEs. Overall, we found that both Class 1 and 2 TE families account for approximately 70% of the genome size difference between B73 and luxurians. Interestingly, the relative abundance of TE families was conserved between species (r = 0.97), suggesting genome-wide control of TE content rather than family-specific effects.},

Thus, in principle, adaptations can be mapped by looking for the signature of directional selection in polymorphism data. In practice, such efforts are hampered by the need for an accurate characterization of the demographic history of the species and of the effects of positive selection. In an attempt to circumvent these difficulties, researchers are increasingly taking a purely empirical approach, in which a large number of genomic regions are ordered by summaries of the polymorphism data, and loci with extreme values are considered to be likely targets of positive selection. We evaluated the reliability of the “empirical” approach, focusing on applications to human data and to maize. To do so, we considered a coalescent model of directional selection in a sensible demographic setting, allowing for selection on standing variation as well as on a new mutation. Our simulations suggest that while empirical approaches will identify several interesting candidates, they will also miss many--in some cases, most--loci of interest. The extent of the trade-off depends on the mode of positive selection and the demographic history of the population. Specifically, the false-discovery rate is higher when directional selection involves a recessive rather than a co-dominant allele, when it acts on a previously neutral rather than a new allele, and when the population has experienced a population bottleneck rather than maintained a constant size. One implication of these results is that, insofar as attributes of the beneficial mutation (e.g., the dominance coefficient) affect the power to detect targets of selection, genomic scans will yield an unrepresentative subset of loci that contribute to adaptations.},

abstract = {Maize domestication is one of the greatest feats of artificial selection and evolution, wherein a weedy plant in Central Mexico was converted through human-mediated selection into the most productive crop in the world. In fact, the changes were so astounding that it took much of the last century to identify modern maize’s true ancestor. Through modern genetic studies, the molecular basis of this evolution is being unraveled. Maize’s new morphology and adaptation to diverse environments required selection at thousands of loci, and we are beginning to understand the magnitude and rates of these genetic changes. Most of the known major genes have experienced strong selection, but only small regions surrounding the selected genes exhibit substantially reduced genetic diversity. Here, we report the discovery of a large region on chromosome 10 involved in adaptation or domestication that has been the target of strong selection during maize domestication. Unlike previously described regions in the maize genome, 1.1 Mb and >15 genes lost genetic diversity during selection at this region. Finally, the prospects of a detailed understanding of maize evolution are discussed with consideration of both top-down and bottom-up approaches.},

During this time, changes in maize leaf angle and size have altered plant architecture, allowing more efficient light capture as planting density has increased. Through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the maize nested association mapping panel, we determined the genetic basis of important leaf architecture traits and identified some of the key genes. Overall, we demonstrate that the genetic architecture of the leaf traits is dominated by small effects, with little epistasis, environmental interaction or pleiotropy. In particular, GWAS results show that variations at the liguleless genes have contributed to more upright leaves. These results demonstrate that the use of GWAS with specially designed mapping populations is effective in uncovering the basis of key agronomic traits.},

I briefly discuss human (artificial) selection, natural selection, and food production. Pedigree background frequencies from 33 elite, 1990s era inbreds directly estimate about 40% of U.S. hybrid corn hectarage and indirectly estimate the rest. I’ve searched historical records to trace the succession of cultivars and inbreds. Reid Yellow Dent is 51% of the documented U.S. hybrid corn background (Iodent Reid, 13%; Troyer Reid, 12%; Osterland Reid, 11%; Stiff Stalk Synthetic, 8%; Reid per se, 4%; and Funk Reid, 3%). Minnesota 13 is 13%, Lancaster Sure Crop is 13%, Northwestern Dent is 5%, and Learning Corn is 5%. Five widely adapted, century-old, open-pollinated cultivars surpassed in use tens of thousands of genetically divergent cultivars to account for 87% of the known background of today’s U.S. hybrid corn. Adaptedness mattered; U.S. corn breeders are adapting a tropical crop to a temperate climate. New, diverse background sources will probably be better adapted to longer daylengths, cooler minimum temperatures, drought, shorter seasons, and improved crop production practices. Selecting for adaptation to these conditions and to improved agronomic production practices will continue to increase yield. Traditional corn breeding methods will continue to accommodate climate change. Plant breeding and crop production research provides plentiful food in the USA.},

Genomics-based approaches provide access to agronomically desirable alleles present at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that affect such responses, thus enabling us to improve the drought tolerance and yield of crops under water-limited conditions more effectively. Marker-assisted selection is already helping breeders improve drought-related traits. Analysis of sequence data and gene products should facilitate the identification and cloning of genes at target QTLs. Based on such premises, we envision a quick broadening of our understanding of the genetic and functional basis of drought tolerance. Novel opportunities will be generated for tailoring new genotypes “by design”. Harnessing the full potential of genomics-assisted breeding will require a multidisciplinary approach and an integrated knowledge of the molecular and physiological processes influencing tolerance to drought.},

We used a set of 468 SNPs to characterize fine-scale genetic structure within and between two dense stands of the wild ancestor of maize, teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis). Our analyses confirmed that teosinte is highly outcrossing and showed little population structure over short distances. We found that the two populations were clearly genetically differentiated, although the actual level of differentiation was low. Spatial autocorrelation of relatedness was observed within both sites but was somewhat stronger in one of the populations. Using principal component analysis, we found evidence for significant local differentiation in the population with stronger spatial autocorrelation. This differentiation was associated with pronounced shifts in the first two principal components along the field. These shifts corresponded to changes in allele frequencies, potentially due to local topographical features. There was little evidence for selection at individual loci as a contributing factor to differentiation. Our results demonstrate that significant local differentiation may, but need not, co-occur with spatial autocorrelation of relatedness. The present study represents one of the most detailed analyses of local genetic structure to date and provides a benchmark for future studies dealing with fine scale patterns of genetic diversity in natural plant populations.},

Consequently, these genes are expected to exhibit the signature of selection. We screened 501 maize genes for the signature of selection using microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs). We applied the Ewens-Watterson test, which can reveal deviations from a neutral-equilibrium model, as well as two nonequilibrium tests that incorporate the domestication bottleneck. We investigated two classes of SSRs: those known to be polymorphic in maize (Class I) and those previously classified as monomorphic in maize (Class II). Fifteen SSRs exhibited some evidence for selection in maize and 10 showed evidence under stringent criteria. The genes containing nonneutral SSRs are candidates for agronomically important genes. Because demographic factors can bias our tests, further independent tests of these candidates are necessary. We applied such an additional test to one candidate, which encodes a MADS box transcriptional regulator, and confirmed that this gene experienced a selective sweep during maize domestication. Genomic scans for the signature of selection offer a means of identifying new genes of agronomic importance even when gene function and the phenotype of interest are unknown.},

abstract = {How domestication bottlenecks and artificial selection shaped the amount and distribution of genetic variation in the genomes of modern crops is poorly understood. We analyzed diversity at 462 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellites spread throughout the maize genome and compared the diversity observed at these SSRs in maize to that observed in its wild progenitor, teosinte. The results reveal a modest genome-wide deficit of diversity in maize relative to teosinte. The relative deficit of diversity is less for SSRs with dinucleotide repeat motifs than for SSRs with repeat motifs of more than two nucleotides, suggesting that the former with their higher mutation rate have partially recovered from the domestication bottleneck. We analyzed the relationship between SSR diversity and proximity to QTL for domestication traits and observed no relationship between these factors. However, we did observe a weak, although significant, spatial correlation for diversity statistics among SSRs within 2 cM of one another, suggesting that SSR diversity is weakly patterned across the genome. Twenty-four of 462 SSRs (5%) show some evidence of positive selection in maize under multiple tests. Overall, the pattern of genetic diversity at maize SSRs can be explained largely by a bottleneck effect with a smaller effect from selection.},

A tiered marker analysis with 151 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in 90 individuals of the population indicated that on average six alleles per locus were avaliable for selection. An improved test statistic for selection mapping was developed, in which quantitative trait loci (QTL) are identified through the analysis of allele-frequency shifts at mapped multiallelic loci over generations of selection. After correcting for the multiple tests performed, 25 SSR loci showed evidence of selection. Many of the putatively selected loci were unlinked and dispersed across the genome, which was consistent with the diffuse distribution of previously published QTL for NLB resistance. Compelling evidence fo selection was found on maize chromosome 8, where several putatively selected loci colocalized with published NLB QTL and a race-specific resistance gene. Analysis of F-2 populations derived from the selection mapping population suggested that multiple lilnked loci in this chromosomal segment were, in part, responsible for the selection response for quantitative resistance to NLB.},

This domestication event resulted in the original maize landrace varieties, which were spread throughout the Americas by Native Americans and adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Starting with landraces, 20th century plant breeders selected inbred lines of maize for use in hybrid maize production. Both domestication and crop improvement involved selection of specific alleles at genes controlling key morphological and agronomic traits, resulting in reduced genetic diversity relative to unselected genes. Here, we sequenced 1095 maize genes from a sample of 14 inbred lines and chose 35 genes with zero sequence diversity as potential targets of selection. These 35 genes were then sequenced in a sample of diverse maize landraces and teosintes and tested for selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified eight candidate genes. Extended gene sequencing of these eight candidate loci confirmed that six were selected throughout the gene, and the remaining two exhibited evidence of selection in the 3’ portion of each gene. The selected genes have functions consistent with agronomic selection for nutritional quality, maturity, and productivity. Our large-scale screen for artificial selection allows identification of genes of potential agronomic importance even when gene function and the phenotype of interest are unknown.},
